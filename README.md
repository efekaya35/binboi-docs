# Binboi App

Binboi App is a Next.js App Router product surface for the Binboi platform. It is organized in phases and intentionally prioritizes the public site first, then auth, then the dashboard so the repo stays understandable as backend integrations mature.

## What is in this repo

- Public product site: landing, docs, pricing, changelog, support, plus consistent site navigation.
- Auth flows: login, register, recovery, verification, and invite acceptance routes under a shared auth layout.
- Dashboard: overview, tunnels, tokens, usage, billing, settings, install, integrations, and logs.
- Backend adapters: typed, server-only fetch wrappers for auth, control plane, and billing integrations.
- Repo documentation: README files in the key route, component, constants, and lib folders.
